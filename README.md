# BTP - Blockchain Text Publisher

Welcome to the BTP, a decentralized application that leverages the Ethereum blockchain to offer a text publishing platform with a twist. In the BTP, users can not only write and share their content but also engage with the community through a voting system, all while earning rewards in the form of ERC20 tokens.

## Features

- **Decentralized Publishing**: Users can create and share text content securely on the blockchain.
- **Categorization**: Organize texts into categories for easy navigation and structured discussion.
- **Voting System**: Engage with content by voting, with each action contributing to the content's visibility and the user's reward.
- **ERC20 Rewards**: Contributors and voters receive RewardTokens as incentives for their participation.
- **Web3 Integration**: Connect seamlessly with Ethereum wallets like MetaMask to interact with the platform.

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity, managing the logic for publishing, categorization, voting, and rewards.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Ethers.js**: Utilizing Ethers.js for smooth interaction with Ethereum and smart contract integration.
